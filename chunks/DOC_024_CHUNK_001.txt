## Full Document

Drift Fix: 
1. System Settings > Controllers > Calibrate Control Sticks. 
2. Press 'X' to calibrate. 
3. Use a cotton swab with 99% isopropyl alcohol to clean under the rubber flap of the stick. 

Loose Connection: If Joy-Con disconnects in handheld mode, clean the metal contacts on the side rail with a dry toothbrush.
